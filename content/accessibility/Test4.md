Screen readers make digital content more accessible by turning on-screen text and interface elements into speech or braille. They’re especially helpful for people who are blind or have low vision, allowing them to move through a webpage, read text, find specific information, and understand what’s happening on the screen without needing to see it. Screen readers work on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and more and come with different command styles and features. Some are free, while others are paid, but all share the same goal of making computers easier to use for people who can’t rely on vision alone.



This website doesn’t include its own built-in screen reader, but with the link provided on this page, you can explore a variety of screen reader options and choose the one that works best for your device and preferences. Using these tools alongside the site can help you navigate content more comfortably and experience the information as it was meant to be accessed.
