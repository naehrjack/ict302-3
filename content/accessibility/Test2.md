## Resizable Text
Resizable text is an accessibility feature that allows users to adjust the size of on-screen text to make content easier to read. Many people rely on larger text because of low vision, eye strain, or simply personal comfort. Modern browsers and operating systems include built-in zoom tools or text-size settings that let users increase or decrease font size without breaking the layout of a site. Designers are encouraged to build pages that remain readable and functional at 200% zoom or higher, ensuring that headings, paragraphs, and navigation all scale smoothly. Even if this site doesn’t implement any advanced resizing controls, understanding how text scaling works highlights the importance of flexibility, readability, and user choice in accessible design.
