## Light and Dark Modes
Light and dark modes are two different visual styles used across modern websites and apps to make content easier on the eyes. Light mode uses brighter backgrounds and higher contrast, which feels familiar and clean, especially in daytime or well-lit environments. Dark mode flips that by using darker tones to reduce glare, cut down on eye strain, and make long reading or late-night browsing more comfortable. Many platforms now allow users to switch between the two or match their device’s system settings. Even though this site doesn’t implement a light/dark toggle, understanding the idea helps explain how designers think about accessibility, comfort, and user choice. It’s a simple example of how presentation affects the way people experience content.
