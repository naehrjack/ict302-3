\*\*Color Contrast\*\*

Good color contrast on a webpage makes content easier for everyone to see, especially people with low vision or color blindness. When text stands out clearly from its background, it’s easier to read, navigate, and understand what’s on the page without extra effort. Strong contrast also helps in different lighting conditions—like bright sunlight or dim rooms. Overall, using good contrast is a simple way to make websites more accessible and user-friendly for a wider audience.



For this page, we made sure to use colors with strong contrast so everything is easy to read at a glance. We also checked our choices with a WCAG Color Contrast Checker to confirm that the design meets accessibility guidelines. This helps ensure the page works well for as many people as possible.
