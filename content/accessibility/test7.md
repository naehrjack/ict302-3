## Keyboard Navigation
**Keyboard navigation** consists of a set of features and hardware that allows users to browse the internet with their keyboard as opposed to a mouse or fingerpad. Keyboard navigation consists of many features such as screen readers, magnifiers, and shortcuts to execute desired tasks. A unique feature offered by keyboard navigation is the mouth stick. This tool allows disabled users who cannot use a mouse to use a stick that rests in their mouth to press keys on a specialized keyboard. With these accessibility features, keyboard navigation proves to be an extremely useful and necessary tool to support technological accessibility for those with disabilities.
