## Alternative Text
**_Alternative Text_** is a method of providing supplementary text to any image included in a piece of content to further contextualize it. This is beneficial to those with disabilities who may not be capable of seeing an image or understanding its meaning. Alternative text can be used in the form of words somewhere close to the image that can be read with a screen reader, magnifier, or other tools to describe necessary information about the provided image. These features are also useful when an image contains interactive multimedia. For example: an image within an advertisement that when clicked opens a link to said product listed on the seller's website. By implementing alternative text into this advertisement, it can provide context to those in need to inform them of the image's contents and its ability to be used as a link to the product. Overall, alternative text can be presented in numerous different forms that all meet the different needs of users, making it a very useful tool for facilitating online disability access.
