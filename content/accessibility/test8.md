## Alternative Text
**Alternative Text** is a method of taking an image included in a piece of content and providing text to convey its meaning. This is beneficial to those with disabilities who may not be capable of seeing an image or understanding its meaning, so alternative text can be used in the form of words somewhere next to the image that can be read with a screen reader or magnifier to contextualize the meaning of the provided image. These features are also useful when an image contains interactive multimedia, for example: an image within an advertisement that when clicked opens a link to said item listed on the advertiser's website. With alternative text provided for this advertisement, it provides context to those in need to inform them of the image's contents and its ability to be used as a link to the product in the image. Overall, alternative text can be presented in numerous different forms that all meet the different needs of users, making it a very useful tool for facilitating online disability access.

**Disability access laws such as Section 508** enforce the requirement to include acessibility features online, as the specific guidelines pertaining to alternative text are explained by the US Government:
