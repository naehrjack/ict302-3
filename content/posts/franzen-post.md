Accessibility improves digital experiences by ensuring that websites can be used by people with a wide range of disabilities including visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. Below are several key accessibility features, why they matter, and how they support inclusive design.

---

## Alternative Text

Alternative text (alt text) provides written descriptions for images so users who rely on screen readers can understand visual content.  
It is also important when an image fails to load or when users browse with assistive tools.

Alt text helps:

- Blind or low-vision users  
- Users browsing with images disabled  
- Search engines better understand content  

Good alt text is clear, concise, and communicates the purpose of the image not just what it looks like.

## Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation allows users to move through a webpage without a mouse. This is critical for people with motor disabilities, screen-reader users, or those using alternative input devices such as switches or mouth sticks.

Key features include:

- Tab order  
- Focus states  
- Skip-to-content links  
- Logical navigation structure  

Websites must ensure that all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.

## Light and Dark Modes

Light and dark modes improve visual comfort by letting users choose the interface appearance that best meets their needs. Dark mode helps reduce glare and eye strain, while light mode improves readability in bright conditions.

Although optional, providing both modes supports user preference and accessibility for people with:

- Sensitivity to bright screens  
- Migraines or visual stress  
- Anxiety eased by softer contrast

## Resizable Text

Many users require larger text to read comfortably. Pages should remain usable at **200% zoom or higher** without breaking layout or cutting off content.

Resizable text supports:

- Low-vision users  
- Older adults  
- Users on small screens  

Flexible layouts and responsive units (like `rem` and `em`) improve scalability.

---

## Color Contrast

Color contrast helps distinguish text and important UI elements from their background.  
The WCAG guideline recommends:

- **4.5:1 minimum** for normal text  
- **3:1** for large text  
- Higher ratios for maximum readability  

Good contrast helps users with:

- Low vision  
- Color blindness  
- Reading in bright or dim environments  

---

## Screen Readers

Screen readers convert on-screen content into synthesized speech or braille. They rely on well-structured HTML and semantic elements to describe the layout and meaning of a page.

Screen readers benefit:

- Blind users  
- Users with reading disabilities  
- People navigating without looking at the screen  

Accessible sites use headings, labels, ARIA attributes, and clear structure to improve the reading experience.

Creating accessible websites is not just a legal or ethical obligation it improves usability, reduces friction, and ensures that digital experiences work for everyone. Small improvements in alt text, navigation, contrast, or text size can significantly transform how people interact with your website.
