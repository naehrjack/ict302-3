Making the web accessible ensures that everyone regardless of ability can navigate, understand, and interact with digital content. 

## Why Accessibility Is Essential

Web accessibility allows people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments to use websites with equal access. When developers design with accessibility in mind, the web becomes more usable for **everyone**, not just people with disabilities.

This website highlights and demonstrates several important accessibility principles:

- Alternative Text  
- Keyboard Navigation  
- Light & Dark Modes  
- Resizable Text  
- Color Contrast  
- Screen Readers

To explore these examples in depth, see the extended guide in the next article.

This project exists to help developers understand why accessibility matters and how small improvements can make the web more inclusive.
